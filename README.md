Park or Place Android App
=========================
A New Westminster directions & attractions app, using the Google Places, Maps, and Directions APIs.

The main features are locating parks, shopping malls, and parking meters in around New Westminster. It also gives you directions on driving to those locations, as well as saving locations as favourites. 

See included user manual PDF for screenshots and how to use.

To use the app, you will need to compile it in Android studio and run the app either through a virtual device or an attached android phone.

Prerequisites to compiling in Android Studio
--------------------------------------------

- Android SDK v24
- Latest Android Build Tools
- Android Support Repository
- Android Google Play API


Disclaimer
----------
Since the completion of the app, Google has changed how usage of its APIs are billed. Currently, the app is restricted to, each day, a single use of the Directions API (used in the app for mapping routes between two places) unless I provide a credit card number. Unfortunately this means wayfinding in the app becomes disabled after one use a day.
